Since long-lived assets span multiple changes in organizational leadership, the realization of value over 
the life cycle requires a long-term perspective and consistent stewardship aligned with organizational 
objectives. Effective asset management contributes to organizational objectives and sustainability by

To establish effective asset management, an organization should apply and adopt certain fundamental 
principles. These, consolidated within a structured asset management system, ensure that there is

The Harmonized Structure, which serves as the basis for all ISO Management System Standards,
